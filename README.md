## Big O 

### Things to remember:
- usually 3 case: 
- - best case = Ω (Omega)
- - average case = θ (theta)
- - - worst case = O (Omicron), a.k.a Big O
* we only look at the worst case, Big O

- always reduce is, example:
If there is a linear for loop, O(n) and a contant, O(1) in the same algorythm. Don't write O(1n), reduce it to the worst (hightest) value, O(n)
